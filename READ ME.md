# Expedia

## Introduction
Expedia is a travel booking platform that allows users to search and book flights, hotels, car rentals, and vacation packages. It provides a seamless and efficient user experience for travelers worldwide.

## Project Type
This is a **frontend web application**, focusing on user interface and experience.

## Deployed Structure
The frontend is structured as follows:
```
expedia-ui/
├── index.html        # Main HTML file
├── css/
│   ├── styles.css    # Stylesheets for UI/UX
├── js/
│   ├── app.js       # JavaScript logic and API integrations
├── assets/
│   ├── images/      # Images and icons used in the application
├── README.md        # Documentation
```
The UI is hosted on platforms like **Vercel** or **Netlify** for fast deployment and accessibility.

## Features
